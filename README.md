These are some projects I worked on during my spare time, as well as projects assigned to me during my college days.

## 3D Sphere Project
This project was a college assignment where I had to represent a sphere using:
- Flat shading
- Gouraud shading
- Phong shading

Additional features:
- Translate the sphere
- Change the coordinates of the light source

## A* Algorithm
The A* algorithm is used to find the shortest path to visit every destination.

## N-Queen Problem
This project focuses on solving the N-Queen problem, which involves:
- Determining the position of each queen on an `x` by `x` chessboard
- Ensuring that no queen intersects with another's path
